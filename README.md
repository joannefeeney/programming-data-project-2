# Programming for Data Analysis Project (2)

### By Joanne Feeney

For this project I will examine, fuse, analyse & predict the below paleo-present climate data (and other datasets added to the module home page by the lecturer Brian McGinley):

- https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter01_SM.pdf
- https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/6080

First I import all the packages required for my investigations.

Then I read in the composite Co2 and full temperature datasets and drop any unrequired columns.

Using .info, .describe and .isnull functions to get an idea of what the dataset looks like. Re-naming the columns to a more readable format.

Plotting of the full Co2 dataset and then the last 50 years to see what the Co2 levels in the atmosphere have been for the last 800,000 years.

Plotting temperature data.

Merging datasets together so I have temperature and Co2 all together.
