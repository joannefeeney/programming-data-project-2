"This new version of CO2 composite replaces the old version of Lüthi et al. (2008), which contains the analytical bias described in the article mentioned above and lower quality data and many other sections."
For details about the improvements relative to the previous version see supplementary information of the main article.
For detailed references of all records collected in this file also refer to the supplemetary information of the main article.
For latest anthropogenic data refer to NOAA/Mauna Loa record.
Age unit is in years before present (yr BP) whereas present refers to 1950.

"Note, not all records shown in sheet ""all records"" are part of the composite. "
"If millennial scale or smaller details of the composite are studied, we recommend to look into all records available for that period and not only in the composite."
